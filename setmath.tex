\chapter{Set Theory}
\label{cha:set-math}

Our conception of sets as types with particularly simple homotopical character, cf.\
\autoref{sec:basics-sets}, is quite different from the sets of Zermelo-Frankel set theory, which form a
cumulative hierarchy with an intricate nested membership structure.
For many mathematical purposes, the homotopy-theoretic sets are just as good as
the Zermelo-Fraenkel ones, but there are important differences.

We begin this chapter in \autoref{sec:piw-pretopos} by showing that the category $\uset$ has (most of) the usual properties of the category of sets.
In constructive, predicative, univalent foundations, it is a ``$\Pi\mathsf{W}$-pretopos''; whereas if we assume propositional resizing (\autoref{subsec:prop-subsets}) it is an elementary topos, and if we assume LEM and AC then it is a model of Lawvere's Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.
This is sufficient to ensure that the sets in homotopy type theory behave mostly like sets as used by most mathematicians outside of set theory.

In the rest of the chapter, we investigate some subjects that traditionally belong to ``set theory''.
In \autoref{sec:cardinals,sec:ordinals,sec:wellorderings} we study cardinal and ordinal numbers.
These are traditionally defined in set theory using the global membership relation, but we will see that the univalence axiom enables an equally convenient, more ``structural'' approach.

Finally, in \autoref{sec:cumulative-hierarchy} we consider the possibility of constructing \emph{inside} of homotopy type theory a cumulative hierarchy of sets, equipped with a binary membership relation akin to that of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
This combines higher inductive types with ideas from the field of Algebraic Set Theory.

In this chapter we will often use the traditional logical notation described in \autoref{subsec:prop-trunc}.

\section{The category of sets}
\label{sec:piw-pretopos}

Recall that in \autoref{cha:category-theory} we defined the category \uset to consist of all $0$-types (in some universe \UU) and maps between them, and observed that it is a category (not just a precategory).
We consider successively the levels of structure which \uset possesses.

\subsection{Limits and colimits}
\label{subsec:limits-sets}

Since sets are closed under products, the universal property of products in \autoref{thm:prod-ump} shows immediately that \uset has finite products.
In fact, infinite products follow just as easily from the equivalence
\[ \left(X\to \prd{a:A} B(a) \right) \simeq \left(\prd{a:A} (X\to B)\right) .\]
And we remarked already that the pullback of $f:A\to C$ and $g:B\to C$ can be defined as $\sm{a:A}{b:B} f(a)=g(b)$; this is a set if $A,B,C$ are and inherits the correct universal property.
Thus, \uset is a \emph{complete} category in the obvious sense.

Since sets are closed under $+$ and contain \emptyt, \uset has finite coproducts.
Similarly, since $\sm{a:A}B(a)$ is a set whenever $A$ and each $B(a)$ are, it yields a coproduct of the family $B$ in \uset.
Finally, we showed in \autoref{sec:pushouts} that pushouts exist in $n$-types, which includes \uset in particular.
Thus, \uset is also \emph{cocomplete}.

\subsection{Images}
\label{sec:image}

%We will show that $\uset$ is a $\Pi$W-pretopos. 
Next, we show that $\uset$ is a \define{regular category}, i.e.:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\uset$ is finitely complete.\label{item:reg1}
\item The kernel pair $\proj1,\proj2: (\sm{x,y:A} f(x)= f(y)) \to A$ of any
      function $f : A \to B$ has a coequalizer.\label{item:reg2}
\item Pullbacks of regular epimorphisms are again regular epimorphisms.\label{item:reg3}
\end{enumerate}
%
Recall that a \define{regular epimorphism} is a morphism that is the coequalizer of \emph{some} pair of maps.
Thus in~\ref{item:reg3} the pullback of a coequalizer is required to again be a coequalizer, but not necessarily of the pulled-back pair.

The obvious candidate for the coequalizer of the kernel pair of $f:A\to B$ is its \emph{image}, as defined in \autoref{sec:image-factorization}.
Recall that we defined $\im(f)\defeq \sm{b:B} \brck{\hfib f b}$, with functions 
$\tilde{f}:A\to\im(f)$ and $i_f:\im(f)\to B$ defined by
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{f} & \defeq \lam{a} \pairr{f(a),|\pairr{a,\refl{f(a)}}|}\\
i_f & \defeq \proj1
\end{align*}
fitting into a diagram:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [std] {\sm{x,y:A} f(x)= f(y) & A & \mathsf{im}(f) \\ & & B \\};
\draw[ar] ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[above] {$\proj1$} ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[below] {$\proj2$} ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- node[above] {$\tilde{f}$} (m-1-3);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- node[auto,swap] {$f$} (m-2-3);
\draw[ar,densely dotted] (m-1-3) -- node[auto] {$i_f$} (m-2-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}

Recall that a function $f:A\to B$ is called \emph{surjective} if $\fall{b:B}\brck{\hfib f b}$, or equivalently $\fall{b:B} \exis{a:A} f(a)=b$.
A function $f:A\to B$ between sets is called \emph{injective} if $\fall{a,a':A} f(a) = f(a') \Rightarrow a=a'$, or equivalently if each of its fibers is a mere proposition.
Since these are the $(-1)$-connected and $(-1)$-truncated maps in the sense of \autoref{cha:hlevels}, the general theory there implies that $\tilde f$ above is surjective and $i_f$ is injective, and that this factorization is stable under pullback.

We now identify surjectivity and injectivity with the appropriate category-theoretic notions.
First we observe that categorical monomorphisms and epimorphisms have a slightly stronger equivalent formulation.

\begin{lem}\label{thm:mono}
  For a morphism $f:\hom_A(a,b)$ in a category $A$, the following are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f$ is a \define{monomorphism}: for all $x:A$ and ${g,h:\hom_A(x,a)}$, if $f\circ g = f\circ h$ then $g=h$.\label{item:mono1}
  \item (If $A$ has products) the diagonal map $A\to A\times A$ is an isomorphism.\label{item:mono4}
  \item For all $x:A$ and $k:\hom_A(x,b)$, the type $\sm{h:\hom_A(x,a)} k = f\circ h$ is a mere proposition.\label{item:mono2}
  \item For all $x:A$ and ${g:\hom_A(x,a)}$, the type $\sm{h:\hom_A(x,a)} f\circ g = f\circ h$ is contractible.\label{item:mono3}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  The equivalence of conditions~\ref{item:mono1} and~\ref{item:mono4} is standard category theory.
  Now consider the function $(f\circ -):\hom_A(x,a) \to \hom_A(x,b)$ between sets.
  Condition~\ref{item:mono1} says that it is injective, while~\ref{item:mono2} says that its fibers are mere propositions; hence they are equivalent.
  And~\ref{item:mono2} implies~\ref{item:mono3} by taking $k\defeq f\circ g$ and recalling that an inhabited mere proposition is contractible.
  Finally,~\ref{item:mono3} implies~\ref{item:mono1} since if $p:f\circ g= f\circ h$, then $(g,\refl{})$ and $(h,p)$ both inhabit the type in~\ref{item:mono3}, hence are equal and so $g=h$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
  A function $f:A\to B$ between sets is injective if and only if it is a monomorphism in \uset.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Left to the reader.
\end{proof}

Of course, an \define{epimorphism} is a monomorphism in the opposite category.
We now show that in \uset, the epimorphisms are precisely the surjections, and also precisely the coequalizers (regular epimorphisms).

The coequalizer of a pair of maps $f,g:A\to B$ in $\uset$ is defined as the 0-truncation of a general (homotopy) coequalizer.
For clarity, we may call this the \define{set-coequalizer}.
It is convenient to express its universal property as follows.

% Recall from \autoref{defn:homotopy} the notation $f \sim g$ for homotopy between functions.

\begin{lem}
Let $f,g:A\to B$ be functions between sets $A$ and $B$. The 
{set-co}equalizer $c_{f,g}:B\to Q$ has the property that, for any set $C$ and any $h:B\to C$ with $h\circ f\sim h\circ g$, the type
\begin{equation*}
\sm{k:Q\to C} k\circ c_{f,g}\sim h
\end{equation*}
is contractible.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\label{epis-surj}
For any function $f:A\to B$ between sets, the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f$ is an epimorphism.
\item Consider the pushout diagram
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [std] {A & B \\ \unit & C_f \\};
\draw[ar] (m-1-1) -- node[above] {$f$} (m-1-2);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- node[right] {$\iota$} (m-2-2);
\draw[ar] (m-1-1) -- (m-2-1);
\draw[ar] (m-2-1) -- node[below] {$t$} (m-2-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}
in $\uset$ defining the mapping cone. Then the type $C_f$ is contractible.
\item $f$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $f:A\to B$ be a function between sets, and suppose it to be an epimorphism; we show $C_f$ is contractible.
The basic constructor of $C_f$ corresponding to
$\unit\to C_f$ gives us an element $t:C_f$. We have to show that
\begin{equation*}
\prd{x:C_f} x= t.
\end{equation*}
Note that $x= t$ is a proposition, hence we can use induction on
$C_f$: it suffices to find
\begin{align*}
I_0 & : \prd{b:B} \iota(b)= t\\
I_1 & : \prd{a:A} \opp{\alpha_1(a)} \ct I_0(f(a))=\refl{t}.
\end{align*}
where $\alpha_1:\prd{a:A} \iota(f(a))= t$ is a basic constructor
of $C_f$. Note that $\alpha_1$ is a homotopy from $\iota\circ f$ to
$\mathsf{const}_t\circ f$, so we find the terms
\begin{equation*}
\pairr{\iota,\refl{\iota\circ f}},\pairr{\mathsf{const}_t,\alpha_1}:
\sm{h:B\to C_f} \iota\circ f\sim h\circ f.
\end{equation*}
By the dual of \autoref{thm:mono}\ref{item:mono3}, there is a path
\begin{equation*}
\gamma:\pairr{\iota,\refl{\iota\circ f}}=\pairr{\mathsf{const}_t,\alpha_1}
\end{equation*}
Hence, we may define $I_0(b)\defeq \happly(\projpath1(\gamma),b):\iota(b)=t$.
We also have
\[\projpath2(\gamma) : \trans{\projpath1(\gamma)}{\refl{\iota\circ f}} = \alpha_1. \]
This transport involves precomposition with $f$, which commutes with $\happly$.
Thus, from transport in path types we obtain $I_0(f(a)) = \alpha_1(a)$ for any $a:A$, which gives us $I_1$.

Now suppose $C_f$ is contractible; we show $f$ is surjective.
We first construct a type family $P:C_f\to\prop$ by recursion on $C_f$, which is valid since \prop is a set.
On the point constructors, we define
\begin{align*}
P(t) & \defeq \unit\\
P(\iota(b)) & \defeq \brck{\hfiber{f}b}.
\end{align*}
To complete the construction of $P$, it remains to give a path $\brck{\hfiber{f}{f(a)}} =_\prop \unit$ for all $a:A$.
However, $\brck{\hfiber{f}{f(a)}}$ is inhabited by $(f(a),\refl{f(a)})$.
Since it is a mere proposition, this means it is contractible --- and thus equivalent, hence equal, to \unit.
This completes the definition of $P$.
Now, since $C_f$ is assumed to be contractible, it follows that $P(x)$ is equivalent to $P(t)$ for any $x:C_f$.
In particular, $P(\iota(b))\jdeq \brck{\hfiber{f}b}$ is equivalent to $P(t)\jdeq \unit$ for each $b:B$, and hence contractible.
Thus, $f$ is surjective.

Finally, suppose $f:A\to B$ to be surjective, and consider a set $C$ and two functions
$g,h:B\to C$ with the property that $g\circ f\sim h\circ f$. Since $f$ 
is assumed to be surjective,
we have an equivalence $B\simeq\mathsf{im}(f)$. We have the following equivalences
\begin{align*}
\prd{b:B} (g(b)= h(b))
& \simeq \prd{w:\mathsf{im}(f)} g(\proj1 w)= h(\proj1(w))\\
& \simeq \prd{b:B}{a:A}{p:f(a)= b} g(b)= h(b)\\
& \simeq \prd{a:A} g(f(a))= h(f(a)).
\end{align*}
By assumption, there is an element of the latter type.
\end{proof}

% \begin{rem}
% The above theorem is not true when we replace $\set$ by $\type$
% (replacing it also in the definition of $\mathsf{epi}$ and $\mathsf{epi}'$). 
% However, we do
% get the implications $\textit{ii.}\Rightarrow\textit{iii.}\Rightarrow
% \textit{iv.}$
% \end{rem}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:images_are_coequalizers}
Surjective functions between sets are regular epimorphisms.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Note that it suffices to show that for any function $f:A\to B$, the diagram
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [std] {\sm{x,y:A} (f(x)= f(y)) & A & \mathsf{im}(f) \\};
\draw[ar] ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[above] {$\proj1$} ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[below] {$\proj2$} ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- node[above] {$\tilde{f}$} (m-1-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}
is a coequalizer diagram.

The first thing we have to verify is that there is a homotopy 
$H:\tilde{f}\circ\proj1\sim\tilde{f}\circ\proj2$. Let $\pairr{x,y,p}$ be an element
of $\sm{x,y:A} f(x)= f(y)$. 
Then we have $\tilde{f}(\proj1(\pairr{x,y,p}))= \pairr{f(x),u}$, 
where $u$ belongs to the contractible type $\|\hfiber{f}{f(x)}\|$. 
Similarly, we have a path 
$\tilde{f}(\proj2(\pairr{x,y,p}))= \pairr{f(y),v}$,
where $v$ belongs to the contractible type $\|\hfiber{f}{f(y)}\|$.
Since we have $p:f(x)= f(y)$ and since
$\|\hfiber{f}{f(y)}\|$ is contractible, 
it follows that we get a path from $\tilde{f}(\proj1(\pairr{x,y,p}))$ to
$\tilde{f}(\proj2(\pairr{x,y,p}))$, which gives us our homotopy.

Now suppose that $g:A\to X$ is a function for which there is a homotopy 
$K:g\circ\proj1\sim g\circ\proj2$. We have to show that the space
\begin{equation*}
\sm{h:\mathsf{im}(f)\to X}{L:h\circ\tilde{f}\sim g} h\circ H\sim K
\end{equation*}
is contractible. We will apply unique choice to define a 
function from $\mathsf{im}(f)$ to $X$. Let $R',R:\mathsf{im}(f)\to
X\to\type$ be the relations defined by 
\begin{align*}
R'(w,x) & \defeq\prd{a:A} (\tilde{f}(a)= w)\to (g(a)= x)\\
R(w,x) & \defeq \|R'(w,x)\|.
\end{align*}
Then $\mathsf{atMostOne}(R(w))$ is inhabited for every $w:\mathsf{im}(f)$. 
To see this, note that the type $\mathsf{atMostOne}(R(w))$ is a
proposition. Therefore, there is an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
\big(\prd{w:\mathsf{im}(f)} \mathsf{atMostOne}(R(w))\big)
\simeq\prd{a:A} \mathsf{atMostOne}(R(\tilde{f}(a))).
\end{equation*}
We can simplify this even further to
\begin{equation*}
\prd{a:A} \mathsf{atMostOne}(R^\prime(\tilde{f}(a))).
\end{equation*}
This follows from the assumption that $g(a)= g(a^\prime)$ 
whenever $f(a)= f(a^\prime)$. Let $a:A$, $x,x^\prime:X$,
$u:R^\prime(\tilde{f}(a),x)$ and $u^\prime:R^\prime(\tilde{f}(a),x^\prime)$. 
Then there are the paths $u(a,\refl{\tilde{f}(a)}):g(a)=
x$ and $u^\prime(a,\refl{\tilde{f}(a)}):g(a)= x^\prime$, 
showing that $x= x^\prime$. 

Also, $\|\sm{x:X} R(w,x)\|$ is inhabited for every $w:\mathsf{im}(f)$. Indeed, the space
\begin{equation*}
\prd{w:\mathsf{im}(f)} \big\| \sm{x:X} R(w,x)\big\|
\end{equation*}
is equivalent to the space
\begin{equation*}
\prd{a:A} \big\| \sm{x:X} R(\tilde{f}(a),x)\big\|.
\end{equation*}
The space $\prd{a:A}\sm{x:X} R^\prime(\tilde{f}(a),x)$ is inhabited by
\begin{equation*}
  \lam{a} \pairr{g(a),\lam{a^\prime}{p} K(\pairr{a^\prime,a,p^{-1}})}
\end{equation*}
This shows that the hypotheses of the principle of unique choice are satisfied, so we get an element of
\begin{equation*}
\sm{h:\mathsf{im}(f)\to X}\prd{w:\mathsf{im}(f)} R(w,h(w)).
\end{equation*}
An immediate consequence of the way we constructed our function $h:\mathsf{im}(f)\to X$ is that $h\circ\tilde{f}\sim g$. The result follows
now from the observation that the space
\begin{equation*}
\sm{h^\prime:\mathsf{im}(f)\to X} h^\prime\circ\tilde{f}\sim h\circ\tilde{f}
\end{equation*}
is contractible because $\tilde{f}$ is an epimorphism. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:pb_of_coeq_is_coeq}
Pullbacks of regular epis in \uset are regular epis.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We showed in \autoref{thm:stable-images} that pullbacks of $n$-connected functions are $n$-connected.
  By \autoref{lem:images_are_coequalizers}, it suffices to apply this when $n=-1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:set_regular}
The category $\uset$ is regular.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
$\uset$ has all limits, so it is finitely complete. 
\autoref{lem:images_are_coequalizers} gives
that the kernel pair of each function has a coequalizer.
\autoref{lem:pb_of_coeq_is_coeq} shows that
regular epis are stable under pullback.
\end{proof}

In fact, we didn't really have to prove \autoref{lem:images_are_coequalizers} by hand.
It is a standard lemma in category theory that a category is regular as soon as it admits finite limits and a pullback-stable orthogonal factorization system $(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{M})$ with $\mathcal{M}$ the monomorphisms, in which case $\mathcal{E}$ conists automatically of the regular epimorphisms.
However, the proof of \autoref{lem:images_are_coequalizers} is interesting as an application of unique choice.


\subsection{Quotients}\label{subsec:quotients}
Now that we know that $\uset$ is regular, to show that $\uset$ is exact, we need to show that every
equivalence relation is effective. In other words, given an equivalence
relation $R:A\to A\to\prop$, there is a coequalizer $c_R$ of the pair
$\proj1,\proj2:\sm{x,y:A} R(x,y)\to A$ and, moreover, the $\proj1$ and $\proj2$
form the kernel pair of $c_R$.

We have already seen, in \autoref{sec:set-quotients}, two general ways to construct the quotient of a set by an equivalence relation $R:A\to A\to\prop$.
The first can be described as the set-coequalizer of the two projections
\[\proj1,\proj2:\sm{x,y:A} R(x,y)\to A.\]
The important property of such a quotient is the following.

\begin{defn}
A relation $R:A\to A\to\prop$ is said to be \emph{effective} if the square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [std] {\sm{x,y:A} R (x,y) & A \\ A & A/R \\};
\draw[ar] (m-1-1) -- node[above] {$\proj1$} (m-1-2);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- node[right] {$c_{R }$} (m-2-2);
\draw[ar] (m-1-1) -- node[left]  {$\proj2$} (m-2-1);
\draw[ar] (m-2-1) -- node[below] {$c_R $} (m-2-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}
is a pullback. 
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:sets_exact}
Suppose $\pairr{A,R}$ is an equivalence relation. Then there is an equivalence
\begin{equation*}
(c_R(x)= c_R(y))\simeq R(x,y)
\end{equation*}
for any $x,y:A$. In other words, equivalence relations are effective.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We begin by extending $R$ to a relation $\tilde{R}:A/R\to A/R\to\prop$. After
the construction of $\tilde{R}$ we will show that $\tilde{R}$ is equivalent
to the identity type on $A/R$. We define $\tilde{R}$ by double induction on
$A/R$ (note that $\prop$ is a set by univalence for propositions). We
define $\tilde{R}(c_R(x),c_R(y)) \defeq R(x,y)$. For $r:R(x,x')$ and $s:R(y,y')$,
the transitivity and symmetry 
of $R$ gives an equivalence from $R(x,y)$ to $R(x',y')$. This completes the
definition of $\tilde{R}$. To finish the proof of the proposition, we need
to show that $\tilde{R}(w,w')\simeq w= w'$ for every $w,w':A/R$. We can
do this by showing that the type $\sm{w':A/R} \tilde{R}(w,w')$ is contractible for
each $w:A/R$. We do this by induction. Let $x:A$. We have the element
$\pair{c_R(x),\rho(x)}:\sm{w':A/R} \tilde{R}(c_R(x),w')$, where $\rho$ is
the reflexivity proof of $R$, hence we only
have to show that
\begin{equation*}
\prd{w':A/R}{r:\tilde{R}(c_R(x),w')} \pairr{w',r}=\pairr{c_R(x),\rho(x)},
\end{equation*}
which we do by induction on $w'$. Let $y:A$ and let $r:R(x,y)$. Then we have
the path $p_R(r)^{-1}:c_R(y)= c_R(x)$. We automatically get a path from
$p_R(r)^{-1}\cdot r=\rho(x)$, finishing the proof.
\end{proof}

The second construction of quotients, which uses impredicativity of mere propositions, was as the set of equivalence classes of $R$ (a subset of its power set):
\[ A\sslash R \defeq \setof{ P:A\to\prop | P \text{ is an equivalence class of } R} \]
Note that if we regard $R$ as a function from $A$ to $A\to \prop$, then $A\sslash R$ is equivalent to $\im(R)$, as constructed in \autoref{sec:image}.
Now in \ref{lem:images_are_coequalizers} we have shown that images are
coequalizers. In particular, we immediately get the coequalizer diagram
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [std] {\sm{x,y:A} R (x)= R (y) & A & A\sslash  R.  \\};
\draw[ar] ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[above] {$\proj1$} ([yshift=.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-1.east) -- node[below] {$\proj2$} ([yshift=-.5ex]m-1-2.west);
\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- (m-1-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}
We can use this to give an alternative proof that any equivalence relation is effective and that the two definitions of quotients agree.

\begin{thm}\label{prop:kernels_are_effective}
For any function $f:A\to B$ between any two sets, 
the relation $\ker(f):A\to A\to\type$ given by 
$\ker(f,x,y)\defeq f(x)= f(y)$ is effective. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We will use that $\im(f)$ is the coequalizer of $\proj1,\proj2:
\sm{x,y:A} f(x)= f(y)\to A$.
%we get this equivalence from proposition~\ref{prop:images_are_coequalizers}
Note that the canonical kernel pair of the function 
$c_f\defeq\lam{a} \pairr{f(a),\tau_1(\pairr{a,\refl{f(a)}})}$ consists
of the two projections
\begin{equation*}
\proj1,\proj2:\big(\sm{x,y:A} c_f(x)= c_f(y)\big)\to A.
\end{equation*}
For any $x,y:A$, we have equivalences
\begin{align*}
c_f(x)= c_f(y) & \simeq \sm{p:f(x)= f(y)} p\cdot\tau_1(\pairr{x,\refl{f(x)}})
=\tau_1(\pairr{y,\refl{f(x)}})\\ & \simeq f(x)= f(y),
\end{align*}
where the last equivalence holds because 
$\|\hfiber{f}b\|$ is a proposition for any $b:B$. 
Therefore, we get that
\begin{equation*}
\sm{x,y:A} c_f(x)= c_f(y)\simeq\sm{x,y:A} f(x)= f(y)
\end{equation*}
and hence we may conclude that $\ker f$ is an effective relation 
for any function $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Equivalence relations are effective and there is an equivalence $A/R \simeq A\sslash  R $. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We need to analyze the coequalizer diagram

By the univalence axiom, the space $R (x)= R (y)$ is equivalent to the space of homotopies from $R (x)$ to $R (y)$, which is
equivalent to $\prd{z:A} R (x,z)\simeq R (y,z)$. Since $R $ is an equivalence relation, the latter space is equivalent to $R (x,y)$. To
summarize, we get that $(R (x)= R (y))\simeq R (x,y)$, so $R $ is effective since it is equivalent to an effective relation. Also,
the diagram

\draw[ar] (m-1-2) -- (m-1-3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation*}
is a coequalizer diagram. Since coequalizers are unique up to equivalence, it follows that $A/R \simeq A\sslash  R $.

%\subsection{Predicativity}\label{sec:resizing}
%One may wonder about the predicative interpretation of the quotient constructions above.
%One could argue that the HIT construction is predicative by considering the interpretation of this
%quotient in the setoid model~\cite{Altenkirch1999,coquand2012constructive}. 
%In this model the quotient does not raise the universe level. 
%A similar observation holds for constructions that can be carried out in the groupoid 
%model~\cite{hofmann1998groupoid}. These observations should suffice for the set-level higher inductive 
%types we use in the present paper.
%
%Voevodsky~\cite{Universe-poly} has proposed to allow some impredicativity by adding the following resizing rule:
%\[\text{if } a:\UU_n \text{ and } p:\isprop(a), \text{ then } \mathsf{rr}(a,p): \UU_0,\]
%where $\UU_n$ is any universe and $\UU_0$ is the lowest universe.
%Moreover, when lifted to $\UU_n$, $\mathsf{rr}(a,p)= a$.
%Hence, $\mathsf{rr}$ is an equivalence between $\prop_n$ and $\prop_0$. 
%Here we assume that $\UU_0$ is a subuniverse of $\UU_n$. 
%Another axiom resizes each $\prop_n$ to the lowest universe.
%
%The following replacement axiom is derivable from the resizing axiom; see~\cite{Universe-poly}.
%\note{This doesn't require resizing, only quotients.  HITs work as well.}
%\begin{lem}\label{lem:replacement}
%  Let $\UU$ be a universe and $X:\UU$.
%  If $f:X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ is a surjection and $Y$ is a set, then there exists a $Z:\UU$ which is equivalent to $Y$.
%\end{lem}
%\begin{proof}
%Define $Z\defeq X\sslash \ker f$ using the type of equivalence classes; see~\ref{def:VVquotient}. 
%Then $Z:\UU$, since $\prop_\UU$ is in the lowest universe. Finally, we observe that $Z\defeq X/\ker f\simeq\im f\simeq Y$.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\uset$}{Set} is a \texorpdfstring{$\Pi$}{Π}$\mathsf{W}$-pretopos}
\label{subsec:piw}

The notion of a \emph{$\Pi\mathsf{W}$-pretopos} --- that is, a locally cartesian closed category with finite coproducts, effective equivalence relations, and $\mathsf{W}$-types --- is intended as a ``predicative" notion of topos, i.e.\ a category of ``predicative sets", which can serve the purpose for constructive mathematics that the usual category of sets does for classical mathematics.  

Typically, in constructive type theory, one resorts to an external construction of ``setoids" --- an exact completion --- to obtain a category with such closure properties.  In particular, the well-behaved quotients are required for many constructions in mathematics that usually involve (non-constructive) power sets.  It is noteworthy that HoTT  provides these constructions \emph{internally} (via HITs), without requiring such external constructions.  This represents a powerful advantage of our approach, as we shall see in subsequent examples.

\begin{thm} The category $\uset$ is a $\Pi\mathsf{W}$-pretopos.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We have an initial object $0$ and finite, disjoint sums $A+B$.  These are stable under pullback, simply because pullback has a right adjoint.  Indeed, $\uset$ is locally cartesian closed, since for any map $f:A\to B$ between sets, the ``fibrant replacement" $\sm{a:A}f(a)=b$ is equivalent to $A$ (over $B$), and we have $\prod$-types for the replacement.
We've just shown that $\uset$ is regular (\autoref{thm:set_regular}) and that quotients are effective (\autoref{lem:sets_exact}). We thus have an LCC pretopos. Finally, since the $n$-types are closed under the formation of $\mathsf{W}$-types
(\autoref{sec:w-types}), we see that $\uset$ is a $\Pi\mathsf{W}$-pretopos. 
\end{proof}

One naturally wonders what, if anything, prevents $\uset$ from being a topos? In addition to the structure already mentioned, a topos has a subobject classifier, i.e.\ a pointed object classifying (equivalence classes of) monomorphisms.  (In fact, in the presence of a subobject classifier, things become somewhat simpler: one merely needs cartesian closure in order to get the colimits).  In HoTT,  univalence implies that the type $\prop$ does classify monos, but in general it is as large as the universe $\UU$ over which it is formed by the definition $\prop \defeq \sm{X:U}\isprop(X)$. It is a ``set" in the sense of being a $0$-type, but it is not ``small" in the sense of being an object of $\UU$.

Now consider the following ``resizing rule", with respect to a sequence $\UU_0, \UU_1, \ldots$ of universes:
\[\text{if } a:\UU_n \text{ and\ } \isprop(a), \text{ then } \mathsf{r}_{n}(a): \UU_0\]
where $\UU_n$ is any universe and $\UU_0$ is the lowest universe.
It may also be assumed that $\mathsf{r}_{n}(a) = a$; hence, that $\mathsf{r}_n$ is an equivalence between $\prop_n$ and $\prop_0$. 
This is a version of the ``axiom of impredicativity for mere propositions" mentioned in \autoref{subsec:prop-subsets}.  A related axiom resizes, not just mere propositions $a:\UU$, but each type $\prop_n$ itself, down to the lowest universe --- observe that this can be justified from the previous version just by considering the next higher universe $\UU_1$, in which $\prop_0$ already \emph{is} small.
If we assume some such a resizing rule allowing us to replace the large type $\prop$ with a small type $\Omega:U$ containing all mere propositions, we thereby obtain the usual notion of a subobject classifier.
 
 \begin{thm}\label{thm:settopos} Assuming a resizing rule for mere propositions, together with a type $\Omega:\UU$ of all mere propositions, the category $\uset$ is then an elementary  topos.
 \end{thm}

Another condition sufficient for making $\uset$ into a topos is the law of excluded middle, in the ``mere-propositional" form that we have called LEM; for then we have $\prop = \bool$, which \emph{is} small, and which then also classifies all mere propositions.
In topos theory a well-known sufficient condition for LEM is the axiom of choice, which is of course often assumed as an axiom in classical set theory. We next briefly investigate the relation between these conditions in our setting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Axioms of choice and excluded middle for sets}
\label{subsec:emacinsets}

Recall from \autoref{sec:logic}  the following definitions of the variations on the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle:

\begin{align*}
 \mathsf{LEM}_\infty\;\defeq\;&\ 
  \prd{A:\UU} (A + \neg A)\\
  %
  \mathsf{LEM}\;\defeq\;&\ 
  \prd{A:\UU} \Big(\isprop(A) \to (A + \neg A)\Big)\\
  %
  \mathsf{AC}_\infty\;\defeq\;&\ 
    \Big(\prd{x:X} \sm{a:A(x)} P(x,a)\Big) \\
    & \to\sm{g:\prd{x:X} A(x)} \prd{x:X} P(x,g(x))\\
   %
   \mathsf{AC}\;\defeq\;&\ 
    \prd{X:\set}  \prd{A:X\to\set} \prd{P:\prd{x:X}A(x)\to\prop} \\
    & \Big(\prd{x:X} \Brck{\sm{a:A(x)} P(x,a)}\Big) \\
    & \to\Brck{\sm{g:\prd{x:X} A(x)} \prd{x:X} P(x,g(x))}
\end{align*}

The subscript $\infty$ denotes the absence of any assumptions that the types involved are $n$-types for any $n$, and also the absence of any truncation operations.
The unsubscripted versions, which match most closely the versions assumed in classical set theory, involve a judicious choice of places to apply truncation assumptions and operations.
Of course, there are many other possible variations, involving truncation assumptions and operations into $n$-types for any $n$, which might be placed in some places but not others.

Even if we restrict ourselves to sets (rather than $n$-types for $n>0$), there are other possible variations.
For instance, consider the following generalizations of $\mathsf{LEM}$:
%
\begin{align*}
  \mathsf{LEM}_{0,0}\;\defeq\;&\ \prd{A:\set} (A + \neg A) \\
  \mathsf{LEM}_{0,-1}\;\defeq\;&\ \prd{A:\set} \brck{A + \neg A}.
\end{align*}
%
More generally, we might consider $\mathsf{LEM}_{n,m}\defeq \prd{A:\ntype{n}} \trunc m{A+\neg A}$, with $\mathsf{LEM}$ being $\mathsf{LEM}_{-1,\infty}$.
(If $A$ is a mere proposition, then so is $A+\neg A$; thus $\mathsf{LEM}$ is also the same as $\mathsf{LEM}_{-1,-1}$.)
Similarly, in $\mathsf{AC}$ we might include various homotopy level assumptions on $X$, $A$, and $P$, and/or truncations into various levels.
The implications between these principles have yet to be fully explored, but in this section we will prove the following implications that are most relevant for the study of sets.
\[
\mathsf{LEM}_\infty \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}_{0,0} \Rightarrow  \mathsf{AC} \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}_{0,-1} \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}\Rightarrow \mathsf{AC}_\infty
\]
At one extreme, in \autoref{subsec:pat?}, we showed that $\mathsf{LEM}_\infty$ is inconsistent with univalence, and an inspection of the proof shows that it applies just as well to $\mathsf{LEM}_{0,0}$.
At the other extreme, we have seen that $\mathsf{AC}_\infty$ is provable in pure type theory, without any further assumptions (not even function extensionality).
In this section we will show the implication $\mathsf{AC} \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}_{0,-1}$.

First recall that in \autoref{thm:ac-epis-split} we showed that $\mathsf{AC}$ is equivalent to
\[ \big(\prd{x:X} \brck{Y(x)}\big) \to \bbrck{\prd{x:X} Y(x)} \]
for any $X:\set$ and $Y:X\to\set$.
It is easy to see that this is equivalent to asking that any surjection between sets merely has a section, i.e.\ if $X,Y:\set$ and $f:Y\to X$ then
\[ \big(\fall{x:X}\exis{y:Y} (f(x)=y)\big) \Rightarrow \exis{g:X\to Y}\fall{x:X} f(g(x))=x. \]

In this subsection, we will first show that if every surjective function between sets merely has
a section, then for all propositions $A$ we can decide whether $A$ or $\neg A$
holds, i.e.\ the implication $\mathsf{AC} \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}$.  The implication $\mathsf{AC} \Rightarrow \mathsf{LEM}_{0,-1}$ then also follows.

Recall the notion of \emph{suspension} from \autoref{sec:suspension}.
In the case where $A$ is a proposition, it turns out that the
suspension $\susp(A)$ is equivalent to the quotient $\bool/R$,
where $R$ is the equivalence relation we get by setting
$R(\mathsf{true},\mathsf{false})\defeq A$. This will become clear in the development
below.

\begin{lem}\label{prop:trunc_of_prop_is_set}
The suspension of any proposition $A$ is a set and the path space 
$\north=\south$ in $\susp(A)$ is equivalent to $A$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a proposition. Using the univalence axiom, we will define a 
dependent type $P:\susp(A)\to\susp(A)\to\type$ with the 
property that $P(x,y)$ is a proposition for each $x,y:\susp(A)$ 
and which turns out to be equivalent to the dependent type 
$\mathsf{Id}_{\susp(A)}$.

We make the following definitions:
\begin{align*}
P(\north,\north) & \defeq \unit & P(\south,\north) & \defeq A\\
P(\north,\south) & \defeq A & P(\south,\south) & \defeq \unit.
\end{align*}
To show that this gives a dependent type we need to verify that there 
is an equivalence $P(\north,\north)\simeq P(\north,\south)$ and an eqivalence 
$P(\south,\north)\simeq P(\south,\south)$ for every $a:A$. Since $A$ is assumed to 
be a proposition, this is indeed the case.

Note that $P$ is a reflexive relation. Therefore we may 
apply \autoref{thm:h-set-refrel-in-paths-sets}, so it suffices to
show that $\tau:\prd{x,y:\susp(A)}P(x,y)\to(x=y)$.
We make the definitions
\begin{align*}
  \tau(\north,\north) & \defeq \lam{t} \refl{\north} & \tau(\south,\north) &\defeq \lam{a} \opp{\merid(a)}\\
  \tau(\north,\south) & \defeq \merid & \tau(\south,\south) &\defeq \lam{t} \refl{\south}.
\end{align*}
To find a path $\trans{\merid(a)}{\tau(\north,\north)}=\tau(\north,\south)$ for $a:A$, 
note that because $A$ is a proposition there are paths
\begin{equation*}
(\trans{\merid(a)}{\tau(\north,\north)})(x)=\tau(\north,\north,x)\ct\opp{\merid(a)}
=\opp{\merid(a)}= \opp{\merid(x)}. 
\end{equation*}
Thus we get the requested path from function extensionality. Likewise, 
we obtain a path $\tau(\north)=\tau(\south)$ for every $a:A$, 
which finishes the construction of $\tau$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
For any  type  $A$, we define
\begin{equation*}
\mathsf{isDecidable}(A)\defeq  (A+\neg A).
\end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Bishop/Diaconescu]\label{thm:1surj_to_surj_to_pem}
If all surjections between sets purely have a section, then for all $A:\prop$,
$\mathsf{isDecidable}(A)$. Consequently, if all surjections between sets merely have a section, then for all $A:\prop,
\brck{\mathsf{isDecidable}(A)}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Consider the function $\pi:\mathsf{bool}\to\susp(A)$ defined by 
$\pi(\mathsf{true})\equiv \south$ and $\pi(\mathsf{false})\equiv \north$. 
First  we  show that $\pi$ is surjective, 
by showing that there is a function of type
\begin{equation*}
\prd{x:\susp(A)} \|\hfiber\pi{x}\|.
\end{equation*}
We have the terms 
$\langle{\mathsf{false},\refl{\north}}\rangle:\hfib\pi\north$ 
and $\langle{\mathsf{true},\refl{\south}}\rangle:\hfib\pi\south$. 
Since $\|\hfiber\pi{x}\|$ is a proposition for each 
$x:\susp(A)$, by induction this gives us the claimed surjectivity.

By proposition~\ref{prop:trunc_of_prop_is_set} the suspension of 
a proposition is always a set, so our assumption gives us a 
section $g:\susp(A)\to\mathsf{bool}$ of $\pi$. 
Since $\mathsf{bool}$ has decidable equality, there is an element of
\begin{equation*}
\mathsf{isDecidable}(g(\pi(\mathsf{true}))= g(\pi(\mathsf{false})))
\end{equation*}
and since $g$ is a section of $\pi$ it follows that there is an element of
\begin{equation*}
\mathsf{isDecidable}(\pi(\mathsf{true})=\pi(\mathsf{false}))
\end{equation*}
Now we see that it is enough to show that 
$\pi(\mathsf{true})= \pi(\mathsf{false})$ is equivalent to $A$. 
This we also obtained in proposition~\ref{prop:trunc_of_prop_is_set}.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:ACtoLEM0}
Suppose that all surjections between sets merely have a section. Then for all sets $A$, we have $\brck{A + \neg A}$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
  We have a surjection
\[
A + \neg A \epi \brck{A} + \brck{\neg A} \epi \brck{(\brck{A} + \brck{\neg A})} = \brck{A} \vee \brck{\neg A} = \brck{A} \vee \neg \brck A = \unit
\]
which therefore merely has a section.
But a section of this is exactly an inhabitant of $A+\neg A$, so we have $\brck{A+\neg A}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}\label{thm:ETCS} Assuming the axiom of choice for sets in the form $\mathsf{AC}$, the category $\uset$ is a boolean elementary topos with choice.  In fact, it is also well-pointed and thus satisfies Lawvere's axioms for the \emph{Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets}.
 \end{thm}

We leave the proof of well-pointedness as an exercise for the reader.

\section{The cumulative hierarchy}
\label{sec:cumulative-hierarchy}

We can define a cumulative hierarchy $V$ of all sets in a given universe $\UU$ as a higher inductive type, in such a way that $V$ is again a set (in a larger universe $\UU'$), equipped with a binary ``membership" relation $x\in y$ which satisfies the usual laws of set theory.

\begin{defn}
  The \emph{cumulative hierarchy $V$} relative to a type universe $\UU$ is the
  higher inductive type generated by the following constructors.
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For every $A : \UU$ and $f : A \to V$, there is an element $\vset(A, f)$ : V.
  \item For all $A, B : \UU$, $f : A \to V$ and $g : B \to V$ such that
    %
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:V-path}
      \big(\fall{a:A} \exis{b:B} \id[V]{f(a)}{g(b)}\big) \land \big(\fall{b:B} \exis{a:A} \id[V]{f(a)}{g(b)}\big)
    \end{equation}
    %
    there is a path $\id[V]{\vset(A,f)}{\vset(B,g)}$.
  \item The 0-truncation constructor: for all $x,y:V$ and $p,q:x=y$, we have $p=q$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

In set-theoretic language, $\vset(A,f)$ can be understood as the set that is the image of $A$ under $f$, i.e.\ $\{ f(a) \mid a
\in A \}$, but of course we cannot write this in type theory. The hierarchy $V$ is
bootstrapped from the empty map $! : \emptyt \to V$, which gives the empty set as $\varnothing = \vset(\emptyt,!)$.
Then the singleton $\{\varnothing\}$ enters $V$ through $\unit \to V$, defined as $\ttt \mapsto \varnothing$, and so
on. The type $V$ lives in the same universe as the base universe $\UU$.

The second constructor of $V$ has a form unlike any we have seen before: it involves not only paths in $V$ (which in \autoref{sec:hittruncations} we claimed were slightly fishy) but truncations of sums of them.
It certainly does not fit the general scheme described in \autoref{sec:naturality}, and thus it may not be obvious what its induction principle should be.
Fortunately, like our first definition of the 0-truncation in \autoref{sec:hittruncations}, it can be re-expressed using auxiliary higher inductive types.

We leave it to the reader to work out the details (see \autoref{ex:cumhierhit}).
At the end of the day, the induction principle for $V$ (written in pattern-matching language) says that given $P:V\to \set$, in order to construct $h:\prd{x:V} P(x)$, it suffices to give the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any $f:A\to V$, construct $h(\vset(A,f))$, assuming as given $h(f(a))$ for all $a:A$.
\item Verify that if $f : A \to V$ and $g : B \to V$ satisfy~\eqref{eq:V-path}, then $h(\vset(A,f)) = h(\vset(B,g))$, assuming inductively that $h(f(a)) = h(g(b))$ whenever $f(a)=g(b)$.
\end{enumerate}
The second clause checks that the map being defined must respect the paths introduced in \eqref{eq:V-path}.
As usual when we state higher induction principles using pattern-matching, it may seem tautologous, but is not.
The point is that ``$h(f(a))$'' is essentially a formal symbol which we cannot peek inside of, which $h(\vset(A,f))$ must be defined in terms of. Thus, in the second clause, we assume equality of these formal symbols when appropriate, and verify that the elements resulting from the construction of the first clause are also equal.  

Observe that, by induction, for each $v:V$ there merely exist $A:\UU$ and $f:A\to V$ such that $v=\vset(A,f)$.
Thus, it is reasonable to try to define the \define{membership relation} $x\in v$ on $V$ by setting:
%
% Note: "membership" rather than "elementhood", because "element" is taken.
%
\begin{equation*}
  (x \in \vset(A,f)) \defeq \exis{a : A} x = f(a).
\end{equation*}
%
To see that the definition is valid, we must use the recursion principle of $V$.  Thus, suppose we have a path $\vset(A, f) = \vset(B, g)$
constructed through~\eqref{eq:V-path}. If $x \in \vset(A,f)$ then there merely is $a : A$ such
that $x = f(a)$, but by~\eqref{eq:V-path} there merely is $b : B$ such that $f(a) = g(b)$, hence
$x = g(b)$ and $x \in \vset(B,f)$. The converse is symmetric.

The \define{subset relation} $x\subseteq y$ is defined on $V$ as usual by
%
\begin{equation*}
  (x \subseteq y) \defeq \fall{z : V} z \in x \Rightarrow z \in y.
\end{equation*}

A \define{class} may be taken to be a mere predicate on~$V$. We can say that a class $C : V \to \prop$ is a
  \emph{$V$-set} if there merely exists $v\in V$ such that
%
\begin{equation*}
  \fall{x : V} C(x) \Leftrightarrow x \in v.
\end{equation*}

We may also use the conventional notation for classes:
\[
\setof{ x | C(x) } \defeq \lam{x}C(x)
\]

A class $C: V\to \prop$ will be called \define{$\UU$-small} if all of its values $C(x)$ lie in $\UU$, specifically $C: V\to \prop_{\UU}$.
Since $V$ lives in the same universe $\UU'$ as does the base universe $\UU$ from which it is built, the same is true for the identity types $v=_V w$ for any $v,w:V$. For a well-behaved theory in the absence of propositional resizing, therefore, it will be convenient to have a $\UU$-small ``resizing" of the identity relation, which we can define by induction as follows.

\begin{defn}\label{def:bisimulation}
Define the \define{bisimulation} relation $$\sim\ : V\times V \longrightarrow \prop_{\UU}$$ by double induction over $V$, where for $\vset(A,f)$ and $\vset(B,g)$ we let:
\begin{align*}
\vset(A,f) \sim \vset(B,g) &\defeq\\
&\big(\fall{a:A}\exis{b:B}fa \sim gb\big) \land \big(\fall{b:B}\exis{a:A}fa \sim gb\big)
\end{align*}
\end{defn}
%
To verify that the definition is correct, we just need to check that it respects paths $\vset(A, f) = \vset(B, g)$ constructed through~\eqref{eq:V-path}, but this is obvious, and that $\prop_{\UU}$ is a set, which it is.  Note that $u\sim v$ is in $\prop_\UU$ by construction.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:BisimEqualsId}
For any $u,v:V$ we have $(u=_V v) = (u\sim v)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that $(u\sim v)\to (u=_V v)$.
By induction on $u$ and $v$, we may assume they are $\vset(A,f)$ and $\vset(B,g)$ respectively.
Then by definition, $\vset(A,f)\sim\vset(B,g)$ implies $(\fall{a:A}\exis{b:B}fa \sim gb)$ and conversely.
But the induction hypothesis then tells us that $(\fall{a:A}\exis{b:B}fa = gb)$ and conversely.
So by the path-constructor for $V$ we have $\vset(A,f) =_V \vset(B,g)$.
\end{proof}

Now we can use the resized identity relation to get the following useful principle.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:MonicSetPresent}
For every $u:V$ there is a given $A_u:\UU$ and monic $m_u: A \mono V$ such that $u = \vset(A_u, m_u)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Take any presentation $u = \vset(A,f)$ and factor $f:A\to V$ as $$f = m_u\circ e_u : A \epi A_u \mono V.$$  Clearly $u = \vset(A_u, m_u)$ if only $A_u$ is still in $\UU$, which holds if the kernel of $e_u : A \epi A_u$ is in $\UU$.  But the kernel of $e_u : A \epi A_u$ is the pullback along $f : A\to V$ of the identity on $V$, which we just showed to be $\UU$-small, up to equivalence.  Now, this construction of the pair $(A_u, m_u)$ with $m_u :A_u \mono V$ and $u = \vset(A_u, m_u)$ from $u:V$ is unique up to equivalence over $V$, and hence up to identity by univalence.  Thus by the principle of unique choice \eqref{cor:UC} there is a map $c : V\to\sm{A:\UU}(A\to V)$ such that $c(u) = (A_u, m_u)$, with $m_u :A_u \mono V$ and $u = \vset(c(u))$, as claimed.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}\label{def:TypeOfElements}
For $u:V$, the just constructed monic presentation $m_u: A_u \mono V$ such that $u = \vset(A_u, m_u)$ may be called the \define{type of members} of $u$ and denoted $m_u : [u] \mono V$, or even $[u] \mono V$.  We can think of $[u]$ as the ``subclass of $V$ consisting of members of $u$".
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:VisCST}
  The following hold for $(V, {\in})$:
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{extensionality:}
    %
    \begin{equation*}
      \fall{x, y : V} x \subseteq y \land y \subseteq x \Leftrightarrow x = y.
    \end{equation*}
    %
     \item \emph{empty set:} for all $x:V$, we have $\neg (x\in \varnothing)$.
    %

  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
  \mbox{}
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Extensionality: if $\vset(A,f) \subseteq \vset(B, g)$ then $f(a) \in \vset(B, g)$
    for every $a : A$, therefore for every $a : A$ there merely exists $b : B$ such that
    $f(a) = g(b)$. The assumption $\vset(B, g) \subseteq \vset(A, f)$ gives the other half
    of~\eqref{eq:V-path}, therefore $\vset(A,f) = \vset(B,g)$.
    
  \item Empty set: suppose $x\in \varnothing = \vset(\emptyt,!)$.  Then $\exis{a:\emptyt}x=\, !a$, which is absurd.
  
  \item Pairing: given $u$ and $v$, let $w=\vset(1+1,[\lam{x}u, \lam{x}v])$.

  \item Infinity: take $w = \vset(\nat,I)$, where $I: \nat \to V$ is given by the recursion $I(0) = \varnothing$ and $I(n+1) = I(n)\cup \{I(n)\}$.
 
  \item Union: Take any $v:V$ and any presentation $f :A\to V$ with $v=\vset(A,f)$.  Then let $\tilde{A} \defeq \sm{a:A}[fa]$, where $[fa] \mono V$ is the type of members from \autoref{def:TypeOfElements}.  $\tilde{A}$ is plainly $\UU$-small and has a projection map $\pi:\tilde{A}\to A$.  We then let $w \defeq \vset(\tilde{A}, f\circ\pi)$.
  
  \item Function set: given $u, v:V$, take the types of elements $[u] \mono V$ and $[u] \mono V$, and the function type $[u]\to [v]$.  We want to define a map
  \[
 r: ([u]\to [v])\ \longrightarrow\ V
  \] 
   with ``$r(f) = \{ \langle x, f(x)\rangle\ |\ x:[u] \}$", but in order for this to make sense we must first define the ordered pair $\langle x, y\rangle$, and then we take the map $r': x \mapsto \langle x, f(x)\rangle$, and then we can put $r(f)\defeq \vset([u], r')$.  But the ordered pair can be defined in terms of unordered pairing as usual.
   
  \item $\in$-induction: let $C : V \to \prop$ be a class such that $C(a)$ holds whenever $C(x)$ for all $x\in a$, and take any $v=\vset(B,g)$.  To show that $C(v)$ by induction, assume that $C(gb)$ for all $b:B$.  For every $x\in v$ there merely exists some $b:B$ with $x = gb$, and so $C(x)$.  Thus $C(v)$.

  \item Replacement: the statement ``$C$ is a $V$-set'' is a mere proposition, so we may
    proceed by induction as follows. Supposing $x$ is $\vset(A, f)$, we claim that $w
    \defeq \vset(A, r \circ f)$ is the set we are looking for.  If $C(y)$ then there merely exists
    $z : V$ and $a : A$ such that $z = f(a)$ and $y = r(z)$, therefore $y \in w$.
    Conversely, if $y \in w$ then there merely exists $a : A$ such that $y = r(f(a))$, so
    if we take $z \defeq f(a)$ we see that $C(y)$ holds.

\item Let us say that a class $C: V\to\prop$ is \define{separable} if for any $a:V$ the class $$a\cap C \defeq\setof{x | x\in a \wedge C(x)}$$ is a $V$-set.
We need to show that any $\UU$-small  $C: V \to \prop_\UU$ is separable. Indeed, given $a=\vset(A,f)$, let $A' = \exis{x:A}C(fx)$, and take $f' = f\circ i$, where $i : A' \to A$ is the obvious inclusion.  Then we can take $a' = \vset(A',f')$ and we have $x\in a\wedge C(x) \Leftrightarrow x\in a'$ as claimed.  We needed the assumption that $C$ lands in $\UU$ in order for $A' = \exis{x:A}C(fx)$ to be in $\UU$.\qedhere
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

It is also convenient to have a strictly syntactic criterion of separability, so that one can read off from the expression for a class that it produces a $V$-set.  One such familiar condition is being ``$\Delta_0$", which means that the expression is built up from equality $x=_V y$ and membership $x\in y$, using only propositional logical operations $\neg, \land, \lor, \Rightarrow$ and ((-1)-truncated) quantifiers over particular sets, i.e.\ of the form $\exists(x\in a)$ and $\forall(y\in b)$.  

\begin{cor}\label{cor:Delta0sep}
If the class $C: V \to \prop$ is $\Delta_0$ in the above sense, then it is separable.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Recall that we have a $\UU$-small resizing $x\sim y$ of identity $x = y$. Since $x\in y$ is defined in terms of $x=y$, we also have a $\UU$-small resizing of membership $$x\bin\vset(A,f) \defeq \exis{a:A} x\sim f(a).$$ Now, let $\Phi$ be a $\Delta_0$ expression for $C$, so that as classes $\Phi = C$ (strictly speaking, we should distinguish expressions from their meanings, but we will blur the difference). Let $\widetilde{\Phi}$ be the result of replacing all occurrences of $=$ and $\in$ by their resized equivalents $\sim$ and $\bin$.  Clearly then $\widetilde{\Phi}$ also expresses $C$, in the sense that for all $x:V$, $\widetilde{\Phi}(x) \Leftrightarrow C(x)$, and hence $\widetilde{\Phi}=C$ by univalence.  It now suffices to show that $\widetilde{\Phi}$ is $\UU$-small, for then it will be separable by the theorem.  

We show that  $\widetilde{\Phi}$ is $\UU$-small by induction on the construction of the expression.  The base cases are $x\sim y$ and $x\bin y$, which have already been resized into $\UU$.  It is also clear that $\UU$ is closed under the propositional operations (and $(-1)$-truncation), so it just remains to check the bounded quantifiers $\exists(x\in a)$ and $\forall(y\in b)$.  By definition,  
\begin{align*}
\exists(x\in a) P(x)\ &\defeq \Brck {\sm{x:V}(x\bin a \land P(x))}\\
\forall(y\in b) P(x)\ &\defeq  \prd{x:V}(x\bin a \to P(x))
\end{align*} 
Let us consider $\brck {\sm{x:V}(x\bin a \land P(x))}$.  Although the body $(x\bin a \land P(x))$ is $\UU$-small since $P(x)$ is so by the induction hypothesis, the quantification over $V$ need not stay inside $\UU$.  However, in the present case we can replace this with a quantification over the type $[a]\mono V$ of members of $a$, and easily show that $$\sm{x:V}(x\bin a \land P(x)) = \sm{x:[a]} P(x).$$ 
The righthand side does remain in $\UU$, since both $[a]$ and $P(x)$ are in $\UU$.  The case of $\prd{x:V}(x\bin a \to P(x))$ is analogous, using $\prd{x:V}(x\bin a \to P(x)) = \prd{x:[a]}P(x)$.
\end{proof}

We have shown that in type theory with a universe $\UU$, the cumulative hierarchy $V$ is a model of a ``constructive set theory" with many of the standard axioms, but (as far as we know) without the usual \emph{strong collection} or \emph{subset collection} axioms of the set theory CZF.  We do not expect these to hold, since they seem to be related to the interaction between the type-theoretic axiom of choice $\mathsf{AC}_\infty$ and the (setoid-like) definition of equality in the usual interpretation of CZF into type theory.  Indeed, our model $(V,\in)$ is based on a cumulative hierarchy $V$ which is a higher inductive type \emph{inside} the system, rather than being an \emph{external} construction, and so it is not surprising that it differs in some ways from prior interpretations.

Finally, consider the result of adding the axiom of choice for sets to our type theory, in the form  $\mathsf{AC}$ from \autoref{subsec:emacinsets} above.  This has the consequence that $\mathsf{LEM}$ then also holds, by \autoref{thm:1surj_to_surj_to_pem}, and so $\set$ is a topos with subobject classifier $\bool$, by \autoref{thm:settopos}.  In this case, we have $\prop = \bool:\UU$, and so \emph{all classes are separable}.  Thus we have shown:

\begin{lem}\label{lem:fullsep}
In type theory with $\mathsf{AC}$, the law of \emph{(full) separation} holds for $V$: given \emph{any} class $C : V \to \prop$ and $a : V$, the class $a \cap C$ is a $V$-set.
\end{lem}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:zfc}
In type theory with $\mathsf{AC}$ and a universe $\UU$, the cumulative hierarchy $V$ is a model of Zermelo-Frankel set theory with choice, ZFC.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We have all the axioms listed in \autoref{thm:VisCST}, plus full separation, so we just need to show that there are power sets $\mathcal{P}(a):V$ for all $a:V$.  But since we have $\mathsf{LEM}$ these are simply function types $\mathcal{P}(a) = (a\to\bool)$.
\end{proof}

\sectionNotes

The treatment of the category of sets in \autoref{sec:piw-pretopos} roughly follows that in~\cite{RijkeSpitters}.

The fact that epimorphisms are surjective (\autoref{epis-surj}) is well-known in classical mathematics, but is not as trivial as it may seem to prove \emph{predicatively}.
The proof in~\cite{Mines/R/R:1988} uses the power set operation, although it can be made predicative by using a large power set and typical ambiguity.
\note{Does this just mean ``using universes''?}
A predicative proof for setoids was given by Wilander~\cite{Wilander2010}. 
Our proof is similar to Wilander's, but avoids setoids by using pushouts and univalence.

The notion of $\Pi$W-pretopos, regarded as a predicative version of an elementary topos, was introduced in~\cite{MoerdijkPalmgren}.

The implication in \autoref{sec:surj-split} from $\mathsf{AC}$ to $\mathsf{LEM}$ is an adaptation to homotopy type theory of a theorem from topos theory due to Diaconescu~\cite{Diaconescu}; it was posed as a problem already by Bishop~\cite[Problem 2,p58]{Bishop1967}.

Voevodsky~\cite{Universe-poly} has proposed resizing rules of the kind considered in \autoref{subsec:piw}.  These are clearly related to the notorious \emph{Axiom of Reducibility} proposed by Russell in his and Whitehead's \emph{Principia Mathematica} \cite{WR:PM}.

The idea of algebraic set theory, which informs our development in \autoref{sec:ast} of the cumulative hierarchy, is due to \cite{JoyalMoerdijk}, but it derives from earlier work by \cite{AczelCZF}.

\sectionExercises

\begin{ex}
  Show that if every surjection has a section in the category $\set$, then $\mathsf{AC}$ holds.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Show that with $\mathsf{AC}$, the category $\set$ is well-pointed, in the sense that the following statement holds: for any $f, g : A\to B$, if $f \neq g$ then there is a function $a : 1\to A$ such that $fa \neq ga$.  Show that the ``slice category" $\uset/\bool$ consisting of functions $A\to \bool$ and commutative triangles does not have this property. (Hint: the terminal object in $\uset/\bool$ is the identity function $\bool \to \bool$, so in this category, there are objects $X$ that have no elements $1\to X$.)
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Prove that if $(A,<_A)$ and $(B,<_B)$ are well-founded, extensional, or ordinals, then so is $A+B$, with $<$ defined by
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    (a<a') &\defeq (a<_A a') &\qquad\text{for }& a,a':A\\
    (b<b') &\defeq (b<_B b') &\qquad\text{for }& b,b':B\\
    (a<b) &\defeq \unit &\qquad\text{for }& (a:A),(b:B)\\
    (b<a) &\defeq \emptyset &\qquad\text{for } &(a:A),(b:B)
  \end{alignat*}
\end{ex}
% \begin{proof}
%   We first prove by induction on $<_A$ that every element of $A$ is accessible in $A+B$.
%   This is easy since the only elements less than $a:A$ in $A+B$ are also in $A$.
%   We then prove by induction on $<_B$ that every element of $B$ is accessible in $A+B$.
%   This is easy since we have already proven that every element of $A$ is accessible.
% \end{proof}

\begin{ex}
  Prove that if $(A,<_A)$ and $(B,<_B)$ are well-founded, extensional, or ordinals, then so is $A\times B$, with $<$ defined by
  \[ ((a,b) <(a',b')) \defeq (a<_A a') \vee ((a=a') \wedge (b<_B b')). \]
\end{ex}
% \begin{proof}
%   We prove by induction on $<_A$ that for every $a:A$, every element of the form $(a,b)$ is accessible in $A\times B$.
%   The induction hypothesis is that for all $a'<_A a$, every pair $(a',b)$ is accessible.
%   Inside this induction, we prove by induction on $<_B$ that for every $b:B$, the element $(a,b)$ is accessible.
%   The nested induction hypothesis is that for every $b'<_B b$, the element $(a,b')$ is accessible.
%   But now, if $(a',b')< (a,b)$, then either $a<_A a'$ in which case $(a',b')$ is accessible by the first induction hypothesis, or $a=a'$ and $b'<_B b$, in which case $(a,b')$ is accessible by the second induction hypothesis.
%   Thus, by definition of accessibility, $(a,b)$ is accessible.
%   This completes both inductions.

\begin{ex}
  Show that if $(A,<)$ is well-founded and extensional and $A:\UU$, then there is a simulation $A\to V$, where $(V,\in)$ is the cumulative hierarchy from \autoref{sec:cumulative-hierarchy} built from the universe \UU.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:cumhierhit}
  Given types $A$ and $B$, define a \define{bitotal relation} to be $R:A\to B\to \prop$ such that
  \[ \Big(\fall{a:A}\exis{b:B} R(a,b) \Big) \land \Big(\fall{b:B}\exis{a:A} R(a,b) \Big). \]
  For such $A,B,R$, let $A\sqcup^R B$ be the higher inductive type generated by
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $i:A\to A\sqcup^R B$
  \item $j:B\to A\sqcup^R B$
  \item For each $a:A$ and $b:B$ such that $R(a,b)$, a path $i(a)=j(b)$.

  Show that the cumulative hierarchy $V$ can be defined by the following more straightforward list of constructors, and that the resulting induction principle is the one given in \autoref{sec:cumulative-hierarchy}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For every $A : \UU$ and $f : A \to V$, there is an element $\vset(A, f) : V$.
  \item For any $A,B:\UU$ and bitotal relation $R:A\to B\to \prop$, and any map $h:A\sqcup^R B \to V$, there is a path $\id{\vset(A,h\circ i)}{\vset(B,h\circ j)}$.
  \item The 0-truncation constructor.
  \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
   In the constructive set theory CZF, the \define{axiom of strong collection} has the form:
   \begin{multline*}
   \fall{x\in v}\exis{y} R(x,y) \Rightarrow \\
   \exis{w}\big[\big(\fall{x\in v}\exis{y\in w}R(x,y)\big)\land \big(\fall{y\in w}\exis{x\in v}R(x,y) \big)\big]
   \end{multline*}
   Does it hold in the cumulative hierarchy $V$?  (We do not know the answer to this.)
