\subsection*{About the IAS Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics}

A Special Year on Univalent Foundations was held in 2012-13 at the Institute for Advanced Study, School of Mathematics, organized by Steve Awodey, Thierry Coquand, and Vladimir Voevodsky.  The following people were the official participants.

We did not set out to write a book. The present work has its origins in our collective attempts to develop a new style of ``informal type theory" that can be read and understood by a human being, as a complement to a formal proof that can be checked by a machine.  
Univalent Foundations is closely tied to the idea of a foundation of mathematics that can be implemented in a computer proof assistant.  Although such a formalization is not part of this book, much of the material presented here was actually done first in the fully formalized setting inside a proof assistant, and only later ``unformalized" to arrive at the presentation you find before you --- a remarkable inversion of the usual state of affairs in formalized mathematics.  

Each of the above-named individuals contributed something to the Special Year --- and so to this book --- in the form of ideas, words, or deeds.  The spirit of collaboration that prevailed throughout the year was truly extraordinary. 

Special thanks are due to the Institute for Advanced Study, without which this book would obviously never have come to be --- but which, moreover, proved to be a stimulating and thoroughly enjoyable forge for this new branch of mathematics.  We herewith commit it to the flames of public opinion; may it be sufficiently hardened and tempered to stand the test.
