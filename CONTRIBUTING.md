We are very happy to receive pull requests which fix typos,
formatting, and obvious mathematical errors; which clarify exposition
in a straightforward way; or which add new technical functionality
(such as versions for other devices).  We are not asking for new
mathematical content from the public at this time.

Please make sure that your pull request is attached to the correct
branch.  Changes which add new mathematics, or which alter the
numbering of existing sections, theorems, or equations, must wait for
the second edition.  Other changes, as long as they are not of
unreasonable size, can be released as updates to the first edition.

Corrections of typos and other errors should also be listed in the
errata for the first edition (errata.tex).

We are very grateful everyone who is showing interest in our project,
and to anyone who helps us improve it!  However, in order to avoid any
misunderstanding later, we should mention upfront that your
contributions will only be recorded on github commit logs, but not in
the book itself (because the book is officially an IAS project).
